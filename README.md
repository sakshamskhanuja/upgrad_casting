## Casting

### Description

The following variables have been initialized for you:<br>
int a;<br>
float f;<br>
double d;

You have to cast the variable into different data types as follows:

<ul>
<li>Cast a as float to a variable x.</li>
<li>Cast f as an integer to a variable y.</li>
<li>Cast d as float to a variable z.</li>
</ul>

<b>Hint</b>: You have to initialize the variables x,y and z of proper data types.


<b>Note</b>: The required code to take user input is already written for you. Similar to nextInt(), nextFloat() is used to take floating point data as input and nextDouble() takes a double value as input.

### Input

11<br>
12.2345<br>
12.34567895343534611

### Output

x=11.0 y=12 z=12.345679
